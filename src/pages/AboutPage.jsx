                Rights Tracker is a student-built project from the 2025 Boolean Final Course. Its only aim is to offer a clear, interactive snapshot of how LGBTQ+ rights evolve around the world.

                Start by searching a country or filtering by continent; the list narrows in real time. Click a row to open the full timeline of laws. Need a quick comparison? Add two countries to the comparator and their milestones appear side-by-side. Mark ★ to store favourites—the star travels with you across the site.

                Because legislation changes fast and enforcement can vary by region, treat these pages as a learning tool, not as legal counsel.

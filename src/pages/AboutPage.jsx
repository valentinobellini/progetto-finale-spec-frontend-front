            <p>
                Rights Tracker exists to make one thing easy: seeing, in seconds, how LGBTQ+ rights differ around the world. We track the big legal moments—when a country decriminalises, opens marriage, allows adoption, recognises gender identity, or guarantees trans-specific healthcare—and place them on a single timeline you can search, sort and compare.

                The site isn’t a legal service and it isn’t comprehensive commentary; it’s a public notebook that turns scattered legislation into a clear, shareable snapshot. Use it to spot progress, highlight gaps, and start informed conversations about what still needs to change.

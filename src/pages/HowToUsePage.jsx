                Start at the table. Type a country name in the search bar to narrow the list, or simply scroll.

                <br />

                Save what matters. Tap the ★ icon to add a country to Favourites; the star toggles on/off and the list stays one click away in the top menu.

                Line them up. Tap the scale ⚖ icon on two different rows to send them to the Comparator page. There you’ll see their milestones side-by-side—perfect for a quick “who offers what” check. Remove either country from the comparison bar to pick another.

                That’s it: search, inspect, save, compare. The rest is up to the questions you ask.
